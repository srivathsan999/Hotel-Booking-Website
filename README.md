# Elysian Hotel — Booking Website

## GitHub Pages Setup

This website is ready for GitHub Pages hosting.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Push all files to your GitHub repository**
   - Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
   - All HTML files should be in root
   - `assets/` folder should be in root

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select:
     - Branch: `main` (or `master`)
     - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

3. **Wait for deployment:**
   - GitHub Pages usually takes 1-2 minutes to deploy
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready
   - Your site will be at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Important Notes:

- Make sure your repository is **public** (free accounts require public repos for GitHub Pages)
- The `.nojekyll` file is included to prevent Jekyll processing
- All asset paths use relative paths and should work correctly
